"""
Page configuration and input method selection for the Streamlit frontend.

Responsibilities:
- Configure Streamlit page metadata (title/layout) and render project branding.
- Fetch/cache the project logo (with graceful network failure handling).
- Provide two input methods for URLs: pasted text or uploaded `.txt` file.
- Decode uploaded file content and return a raw, newline-separated URL string.

Public API:
- `configure_page`: Apply page config, render the logo and intro copy.
- `render_input_section`: Render input controls and return raw URL text.

Operational:
- Network: Uses a short-lived `httpx.Client` to fetch the logo; cached for 24h.
- Platform: On Windows, adopts `WindowsProactorEventLoopPolicy` for asyncio compatibility.
- UI: Streamlit-based; decoding/upload errors are surfaced via `st.error`.

Usage:
    configure_page()
    raw_input = render_input_section()

Notes:
- `st.set_page_config(...)` must be called early in the app before other Streamlit rendering.
- The logo request is best-effort; the UI proceeds even if the image can't be fetched.
